# Hi there, I'm Ethan Leyden! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a senior Computer Science student at Virginia Commonwealth University, graduating in May 2025, with a passion for **Data Science** and **Software Engineering**. My journey has been fueled by curiosity, a love for solving complex problems, and a desire to create impactful technology.  

## ðŸŒŸ What Iâ€™m All About  
- **Data Science Enthusiast**: I enjoy uncovering patterns and insights hidden in data, whether it's building predictive models like my NFL Prediction Model or exploring innovative ways to use machine learning for real-world applications.  
- **Software Engineer at Heart**: From developing intuitive front-end applications like a React Color Picker to tackling back-end challenges with databases and APIs, I love building software thatâ€™s efficient, elegant, and user-focused.  
- **Researcher in NLP**: As a Research Assistant at VCUâ€™s NanoNLP Lab, Iâ€™ve worked with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, expanding support for LLMs and generating synthetic training data for Named Entity Recognition systems.  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
I thrive in a variety of technical environments and love learning new tools!  
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, Swift, Common Lisp, PHP, Lua  
- **Frameworks & Tools**: React, Node.js, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, OpenCV, Bootstrap, SLURM  
- **Platforms**: Linux (Arch, Mint, Ubuntu), WordPress, Figma  

## ðŸš€ Notable Projects  
- **RVA Community Fridges**: A capstone project leveraging LoRa microcontrollers to wirelessly monitor 15 community fridges, managed using an Agile workflow.  
- **NFL Prediction Model**: An ongoing personal project using Python and scikit-learn to analyze game data, achieving prediction accuracies of up to 59% with SVM.  
- **Face Detection Research**: Investigated the feasibility of DIY home security with Raspberry Pi and OpenCV, focusing on AI accuracy and computational performance.  

## ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me  
Iâ€™m passionate about creating technology that bridges the gap between people and data, empowering individuals and communities. Whether itâ€™s developing smarter tools, optimizing processes, or diving deep into machine learning challenges, I strive to make a meaningful impact.
